ACMS is a refinement of the basic PHP tools I have been using for the last 10 years.  The end goal of the project is to have a CMS that will be rapidly deployed, secure, and easy to both configure and use.

This project will integrate various open source tools which have proven themselves over and over again.  All tools used and full credit to other developers for their code will be found in CREDITS

On a side note; the security for ACMS will start with the latest release of PHPSecurePages.  I have used this code in various projects but it hasn't been in development since 2005.  I've tweaked it over the past few years but want to get it up to speed with the latest PHP and MySQL.
